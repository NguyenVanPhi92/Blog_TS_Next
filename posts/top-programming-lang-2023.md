7 awesome JavaScript projects to check out today
Here are seven newer JavaScript projects you might not know about yet. These tools and frameworks cover a wide range of functionality and give us insight into emerging trends in JavaScript development. Examples include native app creation, strongly typed full-stack development, a drop-in runtime alternative to Node.js, in-browser graphics, and more. All of the projects are currently being embraced by developers, so they may not be under the radar for long. Just remember, you heard about them here first!

Tauri: A JavaScript framework for desktop apps
Tauri is a JavaScript framework for building desktop applications. Perhaps “meta-framework” is a better term. It allows you to use any front-end web framework, like React or Svelte, and turn it into a cross-platform “rich” client.

Denjell, a co-founder of Tauri, shared a bit about the incentive for developing a new desktop framework.

Tauri exists to streamline the process of building apps. So if someone is interested in building apps, they might stumble across Tauri. First of all, Tauri builds apps for Mac, Windows, and Linux. This summer, we will release a stable 2.0 that introduces iOS and Android to the mix, as well.
The development process for Tauri is quite interesting. The framework lets you build with the existing pipeline you are using, for example, SvelteKit built with Vite. Tauri can handle any stack that ultimately builds to JavaScript and HTML. It runs against the development server, generating the native desktop client for you as you go.

Denjell describes the development process as follows:
